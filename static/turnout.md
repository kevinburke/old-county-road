# 639 Old County Road

Madison Belmont Apartments is a multifamily apartment complex consisting of 8
buildings. There are four driveways, two entrances and exits. The entrance in
question serves four buildings and 154 parking spaces.

The driveway turns onto Old County Road, a busy street with a speed limit of
30mph. Frequently cars exceed the speed limit on this road. Turning left and
right can be dangerous due to poor ability to see cars, and a short reaction
time necessary to avoid accidents.

The building manager, Rafael Galvez, has been managing for a year and says he
has seen two accidents in that time.

### Curb Allowance

All references to "left" and "right" are in the driveway, facing the street. All
measurements are from the best estimated position of the driver in the car.

To the left side there are about 69 feet of unobstructed curb - 21 feet of red
curb and 48 feet of driveway. Cars become visible about 120-150 feet from the
driver's seat.

Cars frequently park in the 21 feet of red curb, obscuring vision even further.
Here is a photo of a USPS truck parked in the red curb area, not uncommon.

<img class="post-img" src="/static/usps.jpg" />

To the right side there are about 6 feet of unobstructed curb - 2 feet of red
curb and 4 feet of driveway. Cars become visible about 23 feet from the driver's
seat. **However**, you can see around the cars immediately to the right of the
driveway. Roughly, cars are visible on the right between 220 - 320 feet from the
driveway, which gives you an estimate of when they will pass. See the diagram,
which is to scale. The red lines are the state recommended stopping distance.
The black boxes are the closest cars to the red curb areas.

### State Guidelines

The [Caltrans Highway Design Manual][caltrans] recommends a minimum of 200 feet
of "stopping sight distance" for a road with a design speed of 30mph. Per the
manual, "Stopping sight distance also is to be provided for all users, including
motorists and bicyclists, at all elements of interchanges and intersections at
grade, including private road connections."

The [American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials][assocn]
(page 153) recommends similar.

### Resident Survey

Every resident I spoke with agreed that the turnout was dangerous. I could have
easily collected more signatures with more time; every person I spoke with
agreed the turnout was dangerous and was interested in signing.

I collected signatures in two ways: putting flyers on cars in the development
and collecting email from responding residents, and speaking with drivers about
to turn onto Old County Road.

- Kevin Burke (petitioner), 639, left side
- SB, 635, left side
- GK, 635, left side.
- JC, 621, both sides.
- SS, 625, left side.
- LK, 639, left side.
- WH, 635, both sides.
- NG, 625, N/A
- WL, 639, left side.
- GD, 639, left side. (last name a bit mangled; see photo)
- MG, 635, left side.
- AB, 621, left side.
- AR, 639, left side.
- LK, 635, left side.
- JZ, 635, left side.
- JR, 625, left side.
- EG, 625, left side
- Rafael Galvez, 641, left side. Rafael Galvez is the apartment complex manager.

I can share with you privately the physical signatures and emails I collected.

#### Quotes from Residents

**GK:** "I escaped a few accidents trying to take the turn."

**Joan,** has lived here 6 years, does not make left turns because it's too
dangerous. She turns right and makes a U-turn at the JK Automotive shop 400
yards down the road. "Left turn is taking your life into your hands. It's
crazy," said Joan. "I have been almost hit a number of times."

**SS:** "It is near impossible to see the oncoming cars."

**LK:** "My strategy has been to inch out which causes some
oncoming cars to get mad. Once I'm out far enough I hit the gas and hope. It's
extremely dangerous but there aren't any other options."

### Comparison with Nearby Apartments

Old County Road Apartments, at 707 Old County Road, has 135 feet of unobstructed
curb to the left (96 feet of red curb), and you can see cars at least 220 feet
away.

To the right, they have 65.5 feet of unobstructed curb (54.5 feet of red curb),
and you can see cars approaching at least 220 feet away.

According to the Madison Belmont apartment owner, Old County Road Apartments
successfully petitioned the city for an extension of the red curb area. The
petitioner was named Scott Teaford. I tried to find more information but failed;
the leasing agent at the Old County Road apartment complex had no idea this
happened.

Here's a diagram of the Old County Road entrance, where it's clear that you can
see 200 feet (to the red lines) in each direction. The diagram is to scale.

### City Actions

In priority order:

1) Extend the red curb on the left side from 21 feet to 50 feet. This would
increase visibility.

2) Extend the red curb on the right hand side from 2 feet to 40 feet, meeting up
with the existing red curb 42 feet from the driveway.

3) Extend the red curb on the left side from 50 feet to 80 feet, brushing up
against the curb area currently painted green.

4) Add a mirror across the street for viewing oncoming cars; multiple residents
suggested this would help. This would probably require the cooperation of the
property owner, though they may prefer it to more red curbs.

#### Effects of adding red curb

This would result in a loss of 2 parking spaces on the right side and 4 parking
spaces on the left side. The building manager, Rafael Galvez, signed my
petition, and has stated in person and in email he's OK with losing the parking
spaces. Twenty drivers signed the petition.

<img class="post-img" src="/static/rafael-galvez-email-img.png" />

The turnout would become safer, which would reduce the number of accidents on
Old County Road.

People seeking parking would probably go 100 yards down the road, on Old County
Road or on Marine View Ave. There are almost always spaces there. Alternatively,
more people may purchase a second space from the Madison Belmont Apartments for
$50 per month.

Madison Belmont Apartments is a TOD zoned complex located 6 minutes walk from
Caltrain and 7 minutes from the ECR and 398 buses. Reducing the amount of
parking would encourage public transit, walking, biking, carpooling. These
actions would fit with the city's [Climate Action Plan][cap].
